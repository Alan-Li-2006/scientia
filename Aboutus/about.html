    <d class="textbox"><h2>Origins</h2>It was mid-2021 when three innovative high school students saw a problem. A growing one. The internet was filled to the brim with content for people to learn science.<p>.</p>
    The problem? They were either inaccessible to them due to extravagantly high costs or incomprehensible to them due to the writer or bad text formatting.<p>.</p>
    And so, they came together and created Scientia. It grew from the flames of these students’ passion. Fed by their love for science. Flourished on the noble desire to produce education that people deserved.</d>
    <e class="textbox2"><h2>Mission</h2>Money isn’t our objective. Our only objective is for you to learn something. To take in the astounding beauty of scientifically viewing the world around you. To understand the infinite complexities of the universe. As high school students ourselves we understand that science is difficult, and truly understanding some of the mind-bending concepts is even more out-of-reach. We’re providing the resources and information that you need to comprehend these topics. And we’re giving it to you in a way so that you can understand it with ease. <p>.</p>
    What we’re doing is filling in the gaps left by those people who are extremely knowledgeable yet not always crystal clear in their teaching and communication. <p>.</p>
    As people who understand you, think like you and feel like you, we are the people who can truly do such a thing and complement your beautiful pursuit to learn more about science.<p>.</p>
    <p>.</p>
