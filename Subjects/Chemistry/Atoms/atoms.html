          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            As chemistry is the study of matter, its properties and how it
            changes, it is imperative that we understand what matter is
            fundamentally made of.
          </p>
          <p>
            Matter is all around you; it's what you see and touch, things that
            take up space and have mass. But matter, in whatever form it exists
            in, is made up of these tiny atoms which can be thought of as the
            building blocks for all matter. But contrary to what scientists and
            philosophers used to think when they first conceived this idea,
            atoms aren’t indivisible. Atoms have their own complex structure,
            made up of subatomic particles that are infinitely important in
            understanding chemistry.
          </p>
        </textbox1>

        <textbox2>
          <h2>Structure of the Atom</h2>
          <p>
            All atoms are composed of a nucleus at the centre of an atom and an
            electron cloud with one or more electrons that are bound to the
            nucleus. The nucleus is the dense, heavy centre of the atom with,
            and it is what gives virtually all of an atom’s mass (99.94%). The
            electron cloud on the other hand has virtually no mass but is what
            gives an atom most of its volume with a radius 10,000 times greater
            than that of the nucleus. In fact, an atom is pretty much just a
            dense heavy nucleus surrounded by a vast area of empty space with a
            few electrons littered here and there.
          </p>
        </textbox2>

        <textbox3a>
          <h2>The Nucleus</h2>
          <p>
            The nucleus is made up of 2 basic subatomic particles being the
            neutron and proton. These two subatomic particles have approximately
            the same mass and also the same angular momentum or spin. The proton
            has a positive electric charge while the neutron has a negative
            electric charge. These two subatomic particles are held together by
            strong force and in much of high-school chemistry it is unlikely to
            be studying cases where the nucleus undergoes a fundamental chemical
            change such as splitting in two. However, the nucleus is still
            crucial in determining the properties of an atom.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is firstly because the number of protons determines what
            element an atom is. The number of protons is called the atomic
            number and quite simply, this number is the thing that sets atoms
            apart as different elements. For example, all atoms that have 29
            protons in its nucleus must be copper; there are no exceptions. If
            we somehow add or take away a proton from the nucleus, the atom
            changes from one element (with its own set of distinct chemical
            behaviours) to another. The periodic table is arranged using this
            metric, with the table ordering its elements in ascending order of
            atomic number.
          </p>
        </textbox3a>

        <textbox3b>
          <p>
            The second reason why the nucleus is important is because the number
            of neutrons determine the isotope of that element. Isotopes are two
            or more types of the same element that have the same atomic number
            but differ in the number of neutrons. While isotopes generally have
            similar chemical properties, they have different atomic mases and
            physical properties. The thing about isotopes is that there aren’t
            an infinite number of them for one type of atom. Typically, there
            are only a few possible number of neutrons (typically similar to the
            atomic number) for the atom to be stable and not decay rapidly. For
            example, the main isotopes of carbon are carbon-12, carbon-13 and
            carbon-14, with neutron numbers being 6, 7 and 8 respectively
            (carbon having 6 protons). We also calculate the mass number of an
            atom through the nucleus by adding the number of protons with the
            number of neutrons in an atom. For example, the 12 in carbon-12
            indicates the atom’s mass number, derived from 6 protons plus 6
            neutrons.
          </p>
        </textbox3b>

        <textbox4a>
          <h2>Electrons</h2>
          <p>
            Electrons are the subatomic particles found outside the nucleus in
            the electron cloud and are much smaller and lighter than protons or
            neutrons. In fact, they’re 1800 times smaller than protons/neutrons
            and thus have little impact in calculating an atom’s mass. Electrons
            are also negatively charged and thus have an electrostatic
            attraction to the positively charged nucleus. Electrons are quite
            complex to understand and more can be found here but unlike the
            nucleus, electrons can be easily gained or lost by atoms. This is
            because, the electrostatic force keeping electrons attracted to the
            nucleus and within the atom is significantly weaker than the strong
            force holding the nucleus together. In fact, most of the chemistry
            you’ll be learning about has literally everything to do with the
            transferal of these tiny subatomic particles, called electrons, from
            one atom to another. It’s integral to bonds which make molecules and
            compounds possible as well as chemical reactions which are
            responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature.
          </p>
        </textbox4a>

        <textbox5a>
          <h2>The Charge of Atoms and Ions</h2>
          <p>
            We know that the subatomic particles of atoms have their individual
            charges with protons being positive, neutrons, neutral and
            electrons, negative. What this means is that an atom can also have
            an overall charge, seeing as it’s made up of these individually
            charged particles. Quite simply, if the number of protons and
            electrons are the same, the atom has a neutral charge.
          </p>
        </textbox5a>

        <textbox5b>
          <p>
            The neutrons don’t matter for calculating charge as they have
            neutral charge. However, if an atom has more or fewer electrons than
            protons, then the atom has an overall negative or positive charge
            and called an ‘ion’. As an electron is negatively charged, if they
            are more electrons than protons, the atom is a negatively charged
            ion and vice versa. A negatively charged ion is called an anion
            while a positively charged ion is a cation. Since, the number of
            protons cannot be easily changed, the most common way, neutral atoms
            become ions is by losing or gaining electrons. This electron
            transferral is particularly important when looking at bonds later. A
            neutral atom losing an electron causes it to become a cation while
            gaining an electron causes it to be an anion. The charge of atoms is
            important as its one of the key mechanisms through which matter
            interacts: electrostatic attraction and repulsion.
