        <quiz><h2></h1>Play Quiz - Bonds</h2></quiz>
        <textbox1>
          <h2>What are Chemical Bonds?</h2>
          <p>Both organic and non-organic things are made up of atoms, but in most cases, those atoms aren’t just floating around individually. Instead, they’re usually interacting with other atoms (or groups of atoms). In particular, atoms can be connected by strong bonds and organized into molecules or crystals. However, chemical bonds don’t just form from mixing two random substances together. Two substances being mixed is vastly different from 2 substances being chemically bonded with the latter resulting in a compound being formed. A chemical bond is a lasting attraction, link or connection between atoms, ions or molecules that enables the formation of chemical compounds.</p>
        </textbox1>

        <textbox2>
          <h2>Why do Chemical Bonds Form?</h2>
          <p>The most fundamental and simplest reason why atoms form chemical bonds is because atoms are trying to reach the most stable (lowest-energy) state that they can. An important clue to which state this is, can be found in the noble gases in Group 18. These gases are stable, unreactive and unlikely to interact with other elements in reactions. Many atoms become stable when their valence shell is filled with electrons or when they satisfy the octet rule (by having eight valence electrons). If atoms don’t have this arrangement, they’ll “want” to reach it by gaining, losing, or sharing electrons. When this happens, bonds tend to be formed. </p>
        </textbox2>

        <textbox3a>
          <h2>Ionic Bonds</h2>
          <p>Ionic bonds are formed between a metal and a non-metal. Ionic bonds involve the transferral of one or more electrons from one atom to another. This is because some atoms become more energetically stable by gaining or losing an entire electron (or several electrons) in order to achieve a full valence shell. When they do so, atoms form ions, or charged particles. Cations are positive ions formed by losing electrons while negative ions are formed by electron gain and are called anions. 
          </p><p>
          The transfer of electrons then results in the two ions with opposite charges being attracted to each other. This attraction between opposite charges is what makes an ionic bond. In general, the loss of an electron by one atom and gain of an electron by another atom must happen at the same time. 
          </p><p>For example, sodium and chlorine atoms tend to form ionic bonds with each other, creating the compound sodium chloride, or table salt. In order for a sodium atom to lose an electron, it needs to have a suitable recipient like a chlorine atom. Sodium (Na) is in Group 1 and so only has one electron in its valence shell. Thus, it is easier (more energetically favourable) for sodium to donate that one electron rather than to find seven more electrons to fill the outer shell. Because of this, sodium tends to lose its one electron, forming the cation Na⁺. Chlorine (Cl), on the other hand, has seven electrons in its outer shell. In this case, it is easier for chlorine to gain one electron than to lose seven, so it tends to take on an electron and become Cl⁻.
          </p>
        </textbox3a>

        <textbox3pissedoff>
          <p>Thus, sodium will donate its one electron to empty its shell, and chlorine will accept that electron to fill its shell. Both ions now satisfy the octet rule and have complete valence shells. Now, the positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions will attract each other to make sodium chloride, or table salt which consist of ionic bonds. Like many other ionic compounds, it doesn't consist of just one sodium and one chloride ion; instead, it contains many ions arranged in a repeating, predictable 3D pattern (a crystal).</p>
        </textbox3pissedoff>
        <textbox3b>
          <p>
          In order to predict which elements may ionically bond together and in what way, we can use the periodic table as a tool to work out the charge of the typical ion for each element. Since we know atoms generally desire a complete outer shell, looking at the group an element belongs to can tell us the ion it may form. The number of electrons lost or gained depends on the element's group (column in the periodic table).
          </p><p>
          For example, looking at magnesium we can see that it is in Group 2 and thus has 2 valence electrons. As it desires a full valence shell, it will lose two electrons to become a positive cation, Mg²⁺. If for example, it reacted with chlorine which has 7 valence electrons, the magnesium would donate two of its electrons to two separate chlorine atoms creating the compound MgCl₂.
          </p>
        </textbox3b>

        <textbox3c>
          <p>
          The alkaline metals and transition metals are on the left side of the periodic table, with fewer valence electrons that the element wants to lose to achieve a full outer shell. On the other hand, the non-metals and halogens are on the right-hand side of the table with a greater number of valence electrons that want to gain a few more to achieve a full outer shell. 
          </p><p>
          Overall, this results in the general pattern of metals losing electrons to become positively charged cations and non-metals gaining electrons to become negatively charged anions.
          </p>

        <h1>Types of Bonds</h1>
        <stripe></stripe>

        <textbox4a>
          <h2>Covalent Bonds</h2>
          <p>
          A covalent bond is formed when two non-metal atoms share valence electrons. There is no transferral of electrons in this sense. Shared electrons count as valence electrons for both of the atoms and so they can both obtain full valence shells. Covalent bonds are more common than ionic bonds in the molecules of living organisms and are key to the structure of carbon-based organic molecules like DNA and proteins. They are also found in water, carbon dioxide and oxygen. One, two, or three pairs of electrons may be shared between atoms, resulting in single, double, or triple bonds, respectively. The more electrons that are shared between two atoms, the stronger their bond will be. 
          </p>
        </textbox4a>

        <textbox4b>
          <p>
          There are two basic types of covalent bonds: polar and nonpolar. In a polar covalent bond, the electrons are unequally shared by the atoms and spend more time close to one atom than the other. Because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the atoms of different elements, slightly positive and slightly negative charges develop in different parts of the molecule. 
          </p><p>
          A key example of such a polar covalent bond is in water. Nonpolar covalent bonds form between two atoms of the same element, or between atoms of different elements that share electrons more or less equally. For example, molecular oxygen is nonpolar because the electrons are equally shared between the two oxygen atoms. 
          </p>
        </textbox4b>

        <textbox5a>
          <h2>Metallic Bonds</h2>
          <p>
          A metallic bond is a bond that holds the atoms together in a metallic structure. In metallic bonding, metal atoms form a close-packed, regular arrangement. The atoms lose their outer-shell electrons to become positive ions. The outer electrons become a sea of mobile electrons surrounding a lattice of positive ions. The lattice is held together by the strong attractive forces between the mobile electrons and the positive ions. 
          </p>
        </textbox5a>

        <textbox5b>
          <p>The properties of metals can be explained in terms of metallic bonding. Metals conduct electricity as the electrons are free to move. Conduction of heat occurs by vibration of the positive ions as well as via the mobile electrons. Metals are both ductile and malleable because the bonding is not broken when metals are deformed; instead, the metal ions slide over each other to new lattice positions.
