          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Evolution is perhaps one of the most misunderstood and contentious scientific concepts that our society has come across so far. However, evolution is a fundamental cornerstone for biology itself and is incredibly useful in attempting to explain some of the deepest ‘whys’ that humanity has posed. It explains the incredibly biodiversity found on Earth as well as how all species on Earth, including us, have undergone a process of natural selection. 
          </p>

          <h2>Evolution</h2>
          <p>
            In the mid-19th century Charles Darwin conceived his theory of evolution by natural selection. He proposed that evolution is where species of organisms change over time in their heritable characteristics over successive generations. Furthermore, he proposed that new species come from pre-existing species, and that all species share a common ancestor. 
          </p><p>
            In this model, each species has its own unique set of heritable (genetic) differences from the common ancestor, which have accumulated gradually over long periods of time. The repeated splitting off of species from a common ancestor, have produced a multi-level "tree" that links all living organisms. Darwin referred to this process, in which groups of organisms change in their heritable traits over generations, as “descent with modification” which we now call evolution. 
          </p>

        <textbox3a>
          <h2>Natural Selection</h2>
          <p>
            Darwin proposed that the key mechanism or process through which evolution occurs is by natural selection. Natural selection offered a logical explanation for how populations could evolve in a way that meant they were better suited to their environment over time. Darwin first observed that in living organisms, many characteristics or traits are heritable or passed down from parent to offspring. We now know that this can be explained by inheritance via genes. 
          </p>
        </textbox3a>

        <textbox3b>
            <p>
            However, Darwin also observed that these heritable traits are not uniformly passed down from parent to all offspring. In fact, offspring vary in their heritable traits and are slightly different from one another. We now know that this can be explained by mutation or simply, offspring have different inherited information from the mix of traits of their biological parents. Lastly, Darwin observed that often, environments can’t support all the offspring produced meaning that there exists competition for limited resources such as food, habitat and mates in each generation of organisms. Darwin gathered these key observations through travelling the world and seeing a variety of species of plants and animals with the most famous being from the Galapagos Islands. 
            </p><p>
            From those observations, Darwin was able to conclude that within a population, due to random mutation and variation in inherited traits, some organisms will have inherited traits that help them survive and reproduce depending on the environment they’re in. More of these organisms will end up surviving and reproducing while their peers with less helpful or even harmful traits will have less chance of surviving and reproducing. As these beneficial traits are heritable and can be passed down, these traits tend to become more common as generations pass. Eventually, as individuals with helpful traits have consistently higher reproductive success, the whole population will become adapted to its environment. 
            </p><p>
            Natural selection is often called ‘the survival of the fittest’ as it involves brutal competition resulting in the flourishing of certain types of organisms within a population of species and the death of others. 
            </p><p>
            There are several points of confusion or misconceptions surrounding natural selection or evolutionary adaptation. Firstly, evolution doesn’t occur through organisms magically changing themselves and their traits. Instead over a incredibly long period of time, heritable, genetic differences between organisms of a species accumulate and those with favourable traits (such as a long neck to access food, a particular colour of fur to camouflage, etc) end up surviving and reproducing (thus passing on their heritable traits) in greater numbers while those with unfavourable traits or simply traits that aren’t competitively good enough end up dying and reproducing in lesser numbers.
            </p>
        </textbox3b>

        <textbox3c>
            <p>
            Another misconception is about what type of traits, natural selection favours. There aren’t any traits that are somehow inherently superior that natural selection always favours. Instead, the traits that are considered favourable are contingent on the specific environment organisms are living in. Traits that may help an organism survive and reproduce effectively in one environment may not be helpful but actually harmful in anther type of environment. 
            </p><p>
            The last misconception surrounds heritable variation. For natural selection to occur, there must already be variation or differences between individual organisms that are heritable (or defined by the genes of that organism). Heritable variation comes about due to random mutation that causes changes in DNA sequence. Furthermore, sexual reproduction mixes and matches genes variants which result in more variation.

          <h2>Darwin's Finches: A Key Example.</h2>
          <p>
            When Darwin reached the Galapagos islands, he observed a number of different species of birds which had remarkable diversity in the form and function of their beaks. All of the finch-like species were quite similar except that the birds from different islands had different beaks that were specifically to the food available on the island. For example, if the island had hard seeds, the beaks were thick and if there were insects, the beaks were skinny and pointed. 
          </p>
        </textbox4a>

        <textbox4b>
          <p>
            In the example of Darwin's finches, we saw that groups in a single population may become isolated from one another by geographical barriers, such as ocean surrounding islands, or by other mechanisms. Once isolated, the groups can no longer interbreed and are exposed to different environments – in this case types of food. In each environment, natural selection is likely to favour different traits such as a certain beak shape. Over many generations, differences in heritable traits can accumulate between the groups, to the extent that they are considered separate species.
